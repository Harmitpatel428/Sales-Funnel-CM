# 🎉 Sales Funnel - Complete Desktop Application

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED - PERFECT SETUP READY!**

### 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis & Fix:**

**The Problem**: Electron packaged apps couldn't spawn external Node.js processes (`spawn node ENOENT` error)

**The Solution**: Bundled Express server directly into the Electron app instead of spawning external processes

**Technical Changes**:
1. ✅ **Moved Express to dependencies** (not devDependencies) so it gets bundled
2. ✅ **Rewrote main.js** to use Express directly instead of spawning processes
3. ✅ **Updated Electron builder config** to include all necessary files
4. ✅ **Fixed static file serving** with proper Express middleware
