# 🚀 Auto-Commit System Guide

## What is Auto-Commit?

The auto-commit system automatically monitors your files and commits any changes to Git, then pushes them to your repository. This means you never have to manually commit your work again!

## 🎯 How to Start Auto-Commit

### Method 1: Using the Batch File (Easiest)
```bash
# Double-click this file or run in terminal:
start-auto-commit.bat
```

### Method 2: Using npm Script
```bash
npm run auto-commit
```

### Method 3: Direct Node.js
```bash
node auto-commit.js
```

## 📁 What Files Are Monitored

The system watches these directories and files:
- `app/` - All your React components and pages
- `electron/` - Electron main process files
- `public/` - Static assets
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `package-lock.json` - Lock file
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint configuration
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration
- `README.md` - Documentation

## 🚫 What Files Are Ignored

These files/directories are automatically ignored:
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- `.git/` - Git metadata
- `.next/` - Next.js build cache
- `out/` - Static export output
- `dist/` - Electron build output
- `*.log` - Log files
- `*.tmp` - Temporary files
- `*.cache` - Cache files

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **File Monitoring**: Watches for changes in your source files
2. **Debounced Commits**: Waits 2 seconds after the last change before committing
3. **Automatic Staging**: Adds all changed files to Git staging
4. **Smart Commit Messages**: Creates descriptive commit messages with timestamps
5. **Auto Push**: Pushes changes to your remote repository

## 📝 Example Commit Messages

```
Auto-commit: 3 files updated at 1/5/2025, 2:30:45 PM
📁 Files: app/components/LeadTable.tsx, app/dashboard/page.tsx, package.json
```

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** of file changes
- ✅ **Intelligent filtering** of important files only
- ✅ **Debounced commits** to avoid spam
- ✅ **Automatic staging** of all changes
- ✅ **Descriptive commit messages** with timestamps
- ✅ **Auto-push** to remote repository
- ✅ **Error handling** and retry logic
- ✅ **Graceful shutdown** with Ctrl+C

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Starting Auto-Commit
```bash
# Start the system
npm run auto-commit

# Or use the batch file
start-auto-commit.bat
```

### Making Changes
1. Edit any file in `app/`, `electron/`, or `public/`
2. Save the file
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. See the auto-commit message in the terminal
5. Check your GitHub repository - changes are already pushed!

### Stopping Auto-Commit
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
- The system will gracefully stop

## 🔧 Customization

You can modify `auto-commit.js` to:
- Change the commit delay (currently 2 seconds)
- Add more watch paths
- Modify ignore patterns
- Change commit message format
- Add more Git commands

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Always test your changes** before relying on auto-commit
- **The system commits ALL changes** in watched directories
- **Make sure you're on the correct branch** before starting
- **Check your repository** regularly to ensure commits are working
- **Use Ctrl+C to stop** the system when needed

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Never lose work** - everything is automatically saved to Git
- **Continuous backup** - your code is always in the cloud
- **No manual commits** - focus on coding, not Git commands
- **Team collaboration** - others can see your changes in real-time
- **Version history** - every change is tracked with timestamps
